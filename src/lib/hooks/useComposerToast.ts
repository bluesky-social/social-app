/**
 * Enhanced toast hook for iOS modal contexts.
 *
 * The issue on iOS is that when the Composer is presented as a modal,
 * and then a native sheet (image picker) is shown on top, the Toast
 * system using RootSiblings may render in the wrong layer or be blocked.
 *
 * This hook addresses the issue by:
 * 1. Adding substantial delay on iOS to ensure all modal transitions complete
 * 2. Using console.log as a fallback to ensure user gets feedback
 * 3. Waiting for the UI thread to be available
