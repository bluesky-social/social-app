// change, the function itself will remain the same. This means that if you
// use this at a higher level of your tree, and then some state you read in it
// changes, there is no mechanism for anything below in the tree to "react"
// to this change (e.g. by knowing to call your function again).
//
// Also, you should avoid calling the returned function during rendering
// since the values captured by it are going to lag behind.
