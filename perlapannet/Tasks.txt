- ask Codex to symlink Claude.md -> AGENDS.md

follow:
"Change all branding in the repository and UI to clearly differentiate from Bluesky.
Change any support links (feedback, email, terms of service, etc) to your own systems.
Replace any analytics or error-collection systems with your own so we don't get super confused."
