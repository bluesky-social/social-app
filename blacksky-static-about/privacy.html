    <h1>blacksky.community Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 07, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Welcome to blacksky.community. This privacy policy explains our approach to your data when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection by blacksky.community</h2>
    <p><strong>The blacksky.community application itself does not collect, store, track, or share any of your personal information or user data.</strong> We do not operate servers that store your account details, posts, or activity logs.</p>
    <p>Our application functions solely as a client interface to interact with the underlying Bluesky social network (AT Protocol).</p>

    <h2>Reliance on Third-Party Services (AppView and PDS)</h2>
    <p>When you use blacksky.community, you connect to the Bluesky network through a specific AppView and your chosen Personal Data Server (PDS). These services are responsible for storing and managing your account information, posts, social graph, and other associated data.</p>
    <p><strong>Your data handling and privacy are governed by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies of the specific AppView and PDS you use.</strong> blacksky.community simply acts on your behalf to communicate with these services based on the credentials you provide locally on your device.</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend you review the policies of your chosen PDS provider and the AppView you are using. For reference, the Privacy Policy for the default Bluesky service (AppView provided by <a href="https://bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bsky.social</a>) can be found here:</p>
    <p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy</a></p>

    <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
    <p>To function, blacksky.community may store your login credentials or temporary session information on your own device. This data is not accessed by or transmitted to us.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
    <p>blacksky.community does not use cookies or any tracking analytics.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. If we do, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions specifically about the functionality of the blacksky.community application itself (and not about data managed by your PDS or AppView), please email <a href="mailto:contact@forsythpeak.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@forsythpeak.com</a>.</p>
