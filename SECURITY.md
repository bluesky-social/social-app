## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT report possible security vulnerabilities in public channels such as GitHub Issues. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please email us at `security@bsky.app` with a description of the issue.

We will acknowledge the vulnerability as soon as possible - within 3 business days - and follow up when a fix lands. Please avoid discussing the vulnerability until we do so.
